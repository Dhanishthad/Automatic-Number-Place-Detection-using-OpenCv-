## Automatic Number Plate Detection using OpenCv and Python
### Step 1: Importing Libraries
-> cv2: OpenCV library for image processing.<br>
-> os: Standard library for interacting with the operating system.<br>
-> matplotlib.pyplot: Library for plotting images.<br>
-> numpy: Library for numerical operations on arrays.<br>
-> easyocr: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library.<br>
-> imutils: Utility functions for basic image processing tasks.<br>

### Step 2: Read, Grayscale, and Blur the Image
-> cv2.imread: Reads the image from the specified path.<br>
-> cv2.cvtColor: Converts the image to grayscale for easier processing.<br>
-> plt.imshow: Displays the image using matplotlib.<br>
